# TaMatisse

Arduino project for driving TaMatisse, the small painting robot for
the Zukuntfstag 2017 at Tamedia. The Zukuntfstag is a special day in
Switzerland where 10-12 year old kids join their parents for work to
get an impression of the work they are doing.

The name of this project is inspired by Henri Matisse
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Matisse - so our bots have somebody
to look up to.

You can use the PlatformIO IDE (based on Atom) to modify, compile and
upload the project to an Arduino.

At a later stage we'll post some 3D printable STL's of the case and
describe the electronics we've used.
